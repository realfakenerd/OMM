# Product Guidelines - OpenMW Android Modloader

## Design Philosophy
The application should feel like a powerful, professional tool that is deeply connected to the Morrowind experience. It prioritizes clarity and efficiency, ensuring that users can manage complex mod setups with confidence.

## User Interface (UI)
- **Visual Style:** Combine a high-density, functional layout with Morrowind-inspired aesthetic elements (icons, typography, or color accents) to create an immersive but efficient environment.
- **Layout Priority:** Focus on **High Information Density**. Use compact lists and detail panels to provide a comprehensive overview of the mod setup at a glance.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all interactive elements are **Touch-Friendly**, with appropriate sizing and spacing for comfortable use on mobile devices.
- **Clarity & Feedback:** Employ **Visual Clarity** through consistent color-coding (e.g., indicating active status, conflicts, or missing dependencies) and clear, recognizable icons.

## Communication & Tone
- **Voice:** The tone should be **Helpful & Instructive**. Use clear language to explain complex modding concepts and guide the user through the configuration process.
- **Error Handling:** Errors and warnings must be **Explicit & Actionable**. Clearly describe the issue and provide immediate, one-click solutions (e.g., "Sort Load Order," "Resolve Dependency") whenever possible.
- **Terminology:** While being helpful, don't shy away from accurate technical terms that are standard in the Morrowind modding community (e.g., "BSA," "ESP/ESM," "Load Order").

## Interaction Principles
- **Efficiency First:** Minimize the number of taps required for common tasks like activating a mod or changing its position in the load order.
- **Safety First:** Always provide confirmation for destructive actions and ensure that backups are easily accessible.
